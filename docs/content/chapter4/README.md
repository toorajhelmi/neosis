# Chapter 4 — Neo's Learnability

This chapter analyzes a central question in Neosis: to what extent can a Neo, whose internal structure is a self-modifying binary graph driven by mutation and energy constraints, develop the ability to learn? Learning is not explicitly built into the Neo architecture. There is no predefined synaptic plasticity rule, no weight-update mechanism, and no gradient-based training. All changes to structure occur only through mutation. Despite this, Neos can acquire two distinct forms of learning. The first is **In-Life learning**, in which a Neo adjusts its behavior within a single lifetime through state dynamics and small parameter shifts generated by its own circuitry. The second is **Lifetime learning**, where structural mutations accumulate across long survival periods. We refer to the overall capacity for these behaviors as learnability. In this chapter, we formalize learnability, describe the mechanisms through which both In-Life and Lifetime learning arise, and explain why the Neo substrate is sufficient for the emergence of adaptive behavior.

## 4.1 Two Modes of Adaptation

A Neo adapts through:

1. **Lifetime Learning (Slow).**  
   Structural mutations applied by Evo modify $$S$$ and accumulate over extended survival. This determines the long-term evolutionary trajectory of the Neo's computational capacities.

2. **In-Life Learning (Fast).**  
   A Neo may adjust its parameters within a single lifetime through small, energy-limited updates computed by its own internal circuits. These parameter shifts do not change structure $$S$$, but they alter how $$S$$ is used.

Learnability encompasses both modes, but In-Life learning is the primary source of rapid adaptation.

## 4.2 In-Life Learning Through Parameter Drift

In-Life learning arises not from new update laws but from $$S$$ computing how its own parameters should change. For each node $$i$$, a **plasticity head** subgraph produces a parameter adjustment vector

$$
\Delta\theta_i(t) = P_i(\mathbf{V}_t, \mathbf{U}_t, O, N_t),
$$

using the same Lex-based computation as any other part of the Neo.

The Neo then applies a small update:

$$
\theta_i(t+1) = \theta_i(t) + \epsilon\, \Delta\theta_i(t),
$$

with energy cost

$$
\text{Cost}_i(t) = c_\theta \|\Delta\theta_i(t)\|.
$$

These updates let a Neo adapt to new conditions during its own lifetime without involving mutation. This mechanism is evolvable: structures that compute useful $$\Delta\theta_i$$ improve survival and are retained by selection.

## 4.3 Relationship Between Learnability and Survival

In-Life learning enables a Neo to adjust its behavior quickly in response to environmental changes. If these adjustments increase expected energy,

$$
\mathbb{E}[N_t \mid \text{In-Life learning}] > \mathbb{E}[N_t \mid \text{no In-Life learning}],
$$

then evolutionary pressure will favor structures $$S$$ that support effective plasticity heads and stable parameter drift.

Lifetime learning determines what kinds of In-Life learning a Neo can express, while In-Life learning directly shapes immediate survival within the NeoVerse.

## 4.4 Summary

A Neo is learnable when a fixed structure $$S$$ supports behavior that adapts to experience. This adaptation arises either through internal dynamical responses or through small parameter updates computed by the Neo's own circuitry. Lifetime learning shapes structure slowly via mutation, while In-Life learning provides fast, flexible adjustment during a single lifetime.
