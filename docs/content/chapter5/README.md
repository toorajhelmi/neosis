# Chapter 5 — Expressive Power of a Neo

## 5.1 Introduction

This chapter evaluates the representational and computational power of the Neo architecture. We show that finite Neos can emulate any deterministic or stochastic finite-state system, and evolving Neos can emulate any computable dynamical process.

## 5.2 Deterministic Expressivity

### 5.2.1 Threshold Logic as a Universal Boolean Substrate

**Purpose:** Relate Lex to classical threshold logic.

**Expectation:** Use known results to show that any Boolean function can be represented by threshold units.

### 5.2.2 Finite Deterministic Dynamical Systems

**Purpose:** Connect recurrent threshold networks to dynamical system representation.

**Expectation:** Demonstrate that fixed-structure Neos can implement any finite deterministic transition function.

## 5.3 Stochastic Expressivity

### 5.3.1 Probabilistic Threshold Nodes

**Purpose:** Formalize Lex with stochastic input as a probabilistic threshold gate.

**Expectation:** Show how Bernoulli-driven updates produce stochastic transitions.

### 5.3.2 Representation of Markov and Stochastic Automata

**Purpose:** Relate Neo networks to finite probabilistic state machines.

**Expectation:** Show that such structures can implement any finite Markov chain or stochastic automaton.

## 5.4 Computational Universality

### 5.4.1 Recurrent Threshold Networks as Universal Computers

**Purpose:** Connect Neo dynamics to known universality results.

**Expectation:** Cite that recurrent threshold networks are Turing complete, implying universality for fixed topology.

### 5.4.2 Evolving Structure and Open-Ended Growth

**Purpose:** Argue that mutation primitives allow construction of arbitrary computational graphs.

**Expectation:** Show that structural evolution enables Neos to approximate any computable function over time.

## 5.5 Continuous Parameters and Decision Surfaces

### 5.5.1 Continuous Parameterization

**Purpose:** Highlight the role of real-valued parameters in sharpening representational capacity.

**Expectation:** Show how continuous weights and biases create arbitrarily fine decision boundaries.

### 5.5.2 Refinement Through Mutation and In-Life Learning

**Purpose:** Connect parameter evolution to increasing precision.

**Expectation:** Describe how parametric adjustments refine decision functions.

## 5.6 Partial Observability and Internal Memory

### 5.6.1 Perception via Projection

**Purpose:** Address the fact that Neos only observe projected world states.

**Expectation:** Explain how internal memory compensates for missing information.

### 5.6.2 Representing Predictive and Latent-Variable Models

**Purpose:** Illustrate how Neos can learn internal structures needed for prediction.

**Expectation:** Show that recurrent binary states provide sufficient latent capacity.

## 5.7 Summary of Expressive Power

**Purpose:** Consolidate expressivity results.

**Expectation:** Conclude that Neos form an evolving probabilistic recurrent threshold architecture capable of universal deterministic and stochastic computation.
